Write a CUDA program that transposes a matrix of 32-bit floating point numbers. The transpose of a matrix switches its rows and columns. Given a matrix  of dimensions , the transpose  will have dimensions . All matrices are stored in row-major format.

Implementation Requirements

Use only CUDA native features (external libraries are not permitted)
The solve function signature must remain unchanged
The final result must be stored in the matrix output
Example 1:

Input: 2×3 matrix

 
Output: 3×2 matrix

 
Example 2:

Input: 3×1 matrix

 
Output: 1×3 matrix

 
Constraints

1 ≤ rows, cols ≤ 8192
Input matrix dimensions: rows × cols
Output matrix dimensions: cols × rows
